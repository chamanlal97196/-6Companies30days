/*
A top secret message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
You are an FBI agent. You have to determine the total number of ways that message can be decoded, as the answer can be large return the answer modulo 109 + 7.
Note: An empty digit sequence is considered to have one decoding. It may be assumed that the input contains valid digits from 0 to 9 and If there are leading 0’s, extra trailing 0’s and two or more consecutive 0’s then it is an invalid string.

Example 1:

Input: str = "123"
Output: 3
Explanation: "123" can be decoded as "ABC"(123),
"LC"(12 3) and "AW"(1 23).
Example 2:

Input: str = "27"
Output: 1
Explanation: "27" can be decoded as "BG".
